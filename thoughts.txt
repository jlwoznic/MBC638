Upfront cycle time - defining customer expectation - defining for invoicing and payments received.
Too many repeating of processes:
 log book and job tickets are duplicate
 two job tickets for same job in some cases
 
Add more people to the process - serial versus adding individuals to do parallel processes
 - send a courier to do mailbox/bank
 - secretary to listen to calls and call customers
 - maybe just address calls when they come in

Decrease time between job completion and invoice generation/delivery (more than just Wednesday)
Maybe use single job ticket/invoice combination  - maybe just use QuickBooks

Repeating at wrong steps - should repeating things like invoicing and bank
